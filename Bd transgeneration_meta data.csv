Data,Explanation 
Experiment 1,"one generation (F1) only exposed to metals, and returned to metal-free env. in F2 and F3"
Experiment 2,cross generations exposed to metals in F1 and F2
Experiment 3,"continuous exposure in the same metal levels in F1, F2, and F3"
F1,first generation 
F2,second generation 
F3,third generation 
colony,counted colonies on the culture
population size,measured absorbance rate of flooded cultures using spectrophotometer (OD 492 nm)
total zoospores,counted both dead and live zoospores
